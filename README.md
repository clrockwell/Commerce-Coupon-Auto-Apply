# UPDATE
After learning more about Commerce 2.x, and help from @bojanz, this module is useless other than a learning experience :D.  In Commerce Promotion, if you *do not add* a coupon to a promotion the promotion will auto-apply based on your configuration.

While this wasn't intuitive to me at first - I imagine it is very much the industry norm.  Essentially, it is a "Coupon-not-required Promotion".  If you add coupons, it assumes you want a "Coupon required Promotion".  Makes perfect sense now.

# Commerce-Coupon-Auto-Apply
Provides ability for admin to configure a coupon to be auto-applied if conditions are met
